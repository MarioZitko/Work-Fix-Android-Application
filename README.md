# Work-Fix-Android-Application
Work Fix is an unfinished mobile application that is being developed with Kotlin through Android Studio.
The application's purpose is to help people with their social media addictions.
The way to do so is by rewarding the user with virtual in-game coins, which would be eligible to spend on virtual property with which you may edit your world.
The application is based on Gamification, which was the Theme for TVZ Mc2 Mobile Challenge Cup of 2022. The app made it to the Cup Semi-Finals.
The app is currently functional, the responsiveness and the design is being worked on.
